Add external and common projects. Run setup.sh.

For Maven usage the previous step is not needed.
Just type 
    mvn clean install
to build the ear in JBCoolEAR/target

Copy the ear in $JBOSS_HOME/standalone/deployments after having the
datasource defined as well as messaging queue which are needed by schedulers.
A correct and working standalone.xml file is needed in order for the
ear to correctly deploy.

I have tested that instead of installing new modules is possible for
DB drivers to deploy the jar files directly in 
JBOSS_HOME/standalone/deployments
